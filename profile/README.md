# ChronixHQ

### Sovereign. Self-Contained. High-Performance.

ChronixHQ is dedicated to building infrastructure tools that prioritize data sovereignty and operational simplicity. Our tools are designed to run anywhere—from local workstations to air-gapped data centers—without external dependencies or cloud-only locks.

**Our Core Principles:**
* **Zero Dependencies**: Single-binary distributions with integrated persistence.
* **Local First**: Your data stays on your hardware, managed by your rules.
* **Enterprise Security**: Advanced orchestration via secure, firewall-friendly protocols.
